# This is OSS Final Project

### What does this project do? : design credits check page

AI Computer Science and Electronic Engineering Students can self-check design credits they have taken so far  <br>
before taking Capstone Design classes, and check design credit that they would take!

I used HTML, jquery, javascript, css, google font, etc. for this project.

### Why is this project useful?

In order to complete the engineering certification system, <br>
computer engineering students and electronic engineering students must be familiar with design credits, 
one of the graduation conditions.  <br>
However, students often find it cumbersome to check how many credits they have taken so far and 
what they have to take among the remaining subjects. <br>
In that situation, if students use this page, it will definitely be easy to locate themselves.

### How to get started?
It's so easy! <br>
After you <b>clone</b> this GitHub code,<br> you can just drag the file to a <b>local browser</b> like Chrome, <br>and you can run this web page that I created, and you can check your design credits.

### Where can people get more help, if needed? 
If you need any help, feel free to email jeeseul565@handong.ac.kr :) <br>
Any questions are welcome.

### contribution to this project 
I took the skeleton and structure of this webpage from w3school. <br>However, I implemented all the detailed functions such as internal content creation,<br> flow configuration, and exception handling. <br>Also, the color, image, and design were modified and reconstructed.
